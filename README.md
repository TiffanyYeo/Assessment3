Javascript Assessment

## What did you like about this project?
Achievable within the timeframe and good structured framework & link to assist the flow and allow learning from assessment at the same time. 
## What did you struggle with in this project?
Not understanding how terminal works or present information, thus no idea how to start. After explanation by Jean, everything is clearer.
## What would make your experience with this assessment better?
Honestly, I would still very much like to have more time in practising the Javascript before having this assessment.
